	<h1>Best Android browser app</h1>             
				<p>As a Google product, Chrome is the perfect browser for Android and, since it comes pre-installed on most phones, it's something that most people are familiar with. Chrome Beta is our current best Android browser app because it's just the better version of the browser we already love.
				</p>
				<p>Chrome beta is Chrome of the future, it's what the standard Chrome app will become once Google applies the latest changes, fixes and improvements it is working on. Chrome beta users get to experience these things before the masses.</p>
				<p>
				The price paid for quicker access to new features is that, of course, sometimes there are bugs or issues that need to be ironed out. None of these will cause any damage to your phone or its software however, and these browser crashes and stutters very rare.</p>

		<h1>Best security/antivirus app</h1>
                <p>Android security is a contentious subject and arguments about the safety of the system crop up frequently. If you are in the market for an antivirus app, our current favorite is Mobile Security & Antivirus from Avast. </p>
				<p>Mobile Security & Antivirus keeps you safe from malware threats with its excellent virus detection software, which can search through your browser history, microSD card, and internal storage space. What's more, it employs anti-theft features such as location tracking and remote data wipe, which work even if your device is not currently in your possession. </p>
				<p>
				As far as free mobile security is concerned, Avast's app is about as comprehensive as it gets. </p>

		<h1>Best Android keyboard app</h1>
		<p>This keyboard is one of the best for fast, accurate typing and it's our new company favorite. Many of us have adopted Fleksy because it's big, it's clever and once you use it for a couple of hours, you realize how useful some of the smaller details are.</p>
<p>For example, most keyboards use a "press and hold delete key" gesture to delete words, Fleksy uses a super-quick backward swipe. Be sure check out some of the extensions like invisible keyboard too - it works surprisingly well. Download it from the Play Store for free now. </p>

<h1>Best app for downloading free music on Android</h1>
<p>
Google Play Music is our favorite app for downloading free music right now. Though there are many music download apps available in the Play Store, they are often quickly removed because of their copyright-impinging functionality. Google Play Music provides you with a totally legit, ever-changing list of free tracks from major artists to download.
</p>
<p>
Spotify has an excellent paid subscription service, and SoundCloud has a multitude of tracks readily available to stream, but for actually downloading tracks to your phone, Google Play Music is as good as you can get.

<h1>
Best image-editing app for Android
</h1>
<p>
PhotoDirector is the whole package. It has everything you could possibly need to edit your photos. The tools range from simple text bubbles and filters, to more complex things such as HSL and curves, and they're all heavily adjustable, helping you get the best out of your photos. It's for messing around on and seeing what you end up with.</p>
<p>The app is developed by CyberLink, a large Taiwanese multimedia software company, so they have the money to splash on an app, and it shows. Highly recommended for novices and pros-on-the-go alike.</p>
